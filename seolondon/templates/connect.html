                    <h2>How we work</h2>

                    <p>SEO Careers is our lateral hiring platform that supports our alumni and like-minded professionals
                        as
                        they progress through their careers.</p>

                    <p>SEO Careers alumni can access opportunities through Connect when seeking their next career move.
                        The
                        platform also welcomes candidates who have not participated in the Careers programme, who have
                        experience in the industries we support.</p>

                    <h2>Why we're unique</h2>

                    <p>Our alumni-driven model means that we can provide our candidates with support long after they
                        leave
                        our programmes. The platform is increasingly connecting alumni, to opportunities not only in the
                        UK,
                        but also in Africa and Asia. SEOâ€™s growing global presence continues to make this possible.</p>
