                                or extended family. The care could have been provided directly by the state (mainly
                                through local authority social services departments) or by the voluntary or private
                                sector (e.g. Barnardo’s, The Children’s Society and many others). It can range from as

                                can do this by selecting "yes" when asked if you are an SEO candidate or selecting "SEO"

                                    required at A-level, university, etc.). Given the extremely high number of
                                    internship applications most banks receive, these grade requirements can often be
                                    very high and therefore result in your application being automatically rejected if
                                    you do not meet them
