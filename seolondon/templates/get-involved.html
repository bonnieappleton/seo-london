                        <p>There are many breeds of dogs. Each breed varies in size and temperament. Owners often select

                        <p>Three common ways for a prospective owner to acquire a dog is from pet shops, private owners,

                        <p>A pet shop may be the most convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a dog from a private owner
                            allows you to assess the pedigree and upbringing of your dog before choosing to take it
                            home. Lastly, finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog who may not
                            find one so readily.</p>

                <h1 class="caps-title teal">Matching mentors to mentees</h1>
                <p>We typically look to match mentees to mentors with common interests or backgrounds. This can include
                    any of the following – secondary school, university, degree, ethnic background, regional background,
                    personal or business interests. Alternatively, if you feel that there is a certain personality type
                    that you would be best suited to mentoring we can also look to ensure your mentee fits this
                    profile.</p>

                        <p>Mentoring on the Scholars programme requires less than one hour a week of your time with the majority
                            of interaction taking place over a secure online e-mentoring platform. This is extremely easy to use
                            and will make interacting with your mentee simple and convenient wherever you are.</p>
                        <p>As the beneficiaries of the Scholars programme are 18 and under, there is a level of safeguarding
                            that we must adhere to. All volunteers offering to become mentors for the Scholars programme must
                            complete a
                            CRB application for an Enhanced Disclosure and attend a child protection &amp; mentoring training

                        <p>We would hope that the time commitment should be no more than a few hours over the course of the
                            summer. This would include meeting the student at least once for a coffee or lunch and then being
                            available for follow up calls and emails during their summer placements. If a student requires any
                            in-depth support this is something that will be provided by the SEO staff and alumni network, where
